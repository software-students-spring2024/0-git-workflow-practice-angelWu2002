**Thoughts**  
The concept of edge computing in public transport, as illustrated by the Icomera X7 mobile-edge routers, is genuinely intriguing. Personally, I find the idea of transforming a public transport vehicle into a mini data center quite revolutionary. This not only speeds up data processing, making it nearly real-time, but also drastically reduces the dependency on distant cloud servers. The immediate processing of data right where it's generated – on the vehicles themselves – is a smart move, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness of the public transport system.

Equally fascinating is how this technology champions data security. In an era where data breaches are a significant concern, processing sensitive information locally on the vehicle strengthens security. It’s impressive how a single onboard system can manage various tasks, from safety monitoring to passenger counting, without compromising data privacy. This seamless integration of multiple functions into one unified system onboard a vehicle feels like a glimpse into the future of public transport – smarter, safer, and more passenger-oriented.

This is a nice article that discusses how edge computing, a technology that processes data close to where it's created, is being used in public transport. By using edge computing, devices like routers on trains can process data right there, which makes things faster and more efficient. This is especially helpful for real-time applications like video surveillance, where quick processing is crucial. The Icomera X7 router is an example of a device that uses edge computing to improve public transport services.

The benefits of edge computing in public transport are numerous. It makes data processing quicker and reduces the need to send all data to a central server, which saves time and bandwidth. This leads to better performance of the transport systems and improved reliability. Also, processing data locally on the vehicle can enhance security since sensitive information doesn't need to travel over the network. Edge computing is a smart way to handle the increasing amount of data in our modern, connected world.
